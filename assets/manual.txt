================================================================================

Welcome to CardioNet! This is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) wrapper around
the powerful nmap network scanning tool. Think of it as a friendly translator
between you and nmap—it helps you build complex scanning commands without
needing to memorize all those cryptic flags.

What can you do with CardioNet?
  - Discover active hosts on your network
  - Identify open ports and running services
  - Detect operating systems
  - Run custom nmap scripts for advanced scanning
  - Export results in multiple formats
  - Build powerful nmap commands visually

Key Shortcuts:
  [R] - Run your scan
  [E] - Export results
  [C] - Clear the results
  [?] - Read the manual
  [Q] - Quit the application


================================================================================
INTERFACE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

CardioNet is divided into three main sections:

HEADER
------
Shows the application name and version. This is just for reference—it
confirms you're running CardioNet!

COMMAND PREVIEW (Middle Top)
----------------------------
This is your window into what's actually being executed. Every time you adjust
a setting, this preview updates to show the exact nmap command that will run.
It starts with "$ nmap" and builds from there. This is super helpful for
learning how nmap commands work!

LEFT PANEL: Scan Configuration
------------------------------
This is where the magic happens. All your scanning options live here:
  - Target: The IP address or network you want to scan
  - Scan Type: Different methods of probing ports
  - Timing: How aggressive or stealthy your scan should be
  - Ports: Which ports to check
  - Output Format: How to save your results
  - Extras: Advanced options like OS detection
  - Scripts: Automated security checks
  - Action Buttons: Run, Clear, Export, and Manual

RIGHT PANEL: Live Results
-------------------------
Shows real-time output as your scan executes. You'll see nmap discovering
hosts, finding open ports, and any other information your scan reveals.

FOOTER

Quick reference for keyboard shortcuts to keep you productive.


================================================================================
SCAN CONFIGURATION PANEL
================================================================================

Let's break down each setting in detail:

TARGET
------
What it is: The IP address or network you want to scan.

Examples:
  - Single host: 192.168.1.1
  - IP range: 192.168.1.0/24 (scans 256 addresses)
  - CIDR notation: 10.0.0.0/8 (scans millions of addresses)
  - Domain name: example.com (nmap will resolve it)

Pro tip: CardioNet suggests common private network ranges as you type.
These are safe for testing on your own networks!


SCAN TYPE
---------
This tells nmap HOW to probe for open ports. Different methods have different
strengths:

SYN Scan (-sS)
  Best for: Most situations. Fast, reliable, and stealthy.
  How it works: Sends SYN packets and waits for responses without completing
               connections.
  Speed: Fast
  Stealth: Pretty stealthy
  Default choice: Yes! This is the safest starting point.

TCP Scan (-sT)
  Best for: When you don't have raw packet privileges or need full
           connections.
  How it works: Completes full TCP handshakes to each port.
  Speed: Slower
  Stealth: Less stealthy (more obvious)
  When to use: On restricted systems where SYN isn't available.

UDP Scan (-sU)
  Best for: Finding UDP services (DNS, DHCP, NTP).
  How it works: Probes UDP ports instead of TCP.
  Speed: Very slow (UDP is inherently slower)
  Stealth: Moderate
  When to use: When you specifically need to find UDP services.

Host Discovery (-sn)
  Best for: Finding which hosts are alive without detailed port info.
  How it works: Quickly pings all addresses to see what's up.
  Speed: Very fast
  Use case: "Are there any servers on this network?" questions.

FIN Scan (-sF)
  Best for: Bypassing older firewalls.
  How it works: Sends TCP FIN packets (stealthy technique).
  Speed: Slow
  Stealth: Very stealthy (some firewalls don't understand it)
  When to use: Advanced users testing firewall configurations.

ACK Scan (-sA)
  Best for: Mapping firewall rules (not for finding open ports).
  How it works: Tests which ports are filtered.
  Speed: Fast
  Stealth: Very stealthy
  Use case: "What's this firewall blocking?"

Xmas Scan (-sX)
  Best for: Stealthy reconnaissance on older systems.
  How it works: Sets all flags in packets.
  Speed: Slow
  Stealth: Very stealthy
  When to use: Advanced reconnaissance techniques.


TIMING TEMPLATES
----------------
Timing controls the SPEED and INTENSITY of your scan:

T0 (Paranoid)
  Speed: Incredibly slow
  Stealth: Maximum stealth
  Use: Avoiding all possible detection
  Perfect for: Pentesting with extreme caution

T1 (Sneaky)
  Speed: Very slow
  Stealth: High stealth
  Use: Avoiding detection while being somewhat practical
  Perfect for: Careful security assessments

T2 (Polite)
  Speed: Slow (nice to network)
  Stealth: Moderate stealth
  Use: Being considerate to network resources
  Perfect for: Shared networks where you don't want slowdowns

T3 (Normal) - The Default
  Speed: Balanced
  Stealth: Balanced
  Use: General scanning without special needs
  Perfect for: Most situations on your own network

T4 (Aggressive) - Recommended
  Speed: Fast
  Stealth: Lower (more obvious)
  Use: Fast scanning of responsive networks
  Perfect for: Friendly networks where speed matters

T5 (Insane)
  Speed: Maximum speed
  Stealth: Very low stealth
  Use: Pure speed at any cost
  Perfect for: Fast, responsive networks where you're not worried about
             detection

Recommendation: Start with T3 or T4 on your own network. Use T0-T2 only for
special situations.


PORTS
-----
Specify which ports to scan. Leave blank to default to the 1000 most common
ports.

Examples:
  - 22,80,443: Scan only SSH, HTTP, HTTPS
  - 1-65535: Scan all possible ports (takes forever!)
  - 20-25: Scan port range
  - 80,443,8000-9000: Mix of specific ports and ranges

Common ports to know:
  22 = SSH (remote access)
  80 = HTTP (web)
  443 = HTTPS (secure web)
  3306 = MySQL (database)
  5432 = PostgreSQL (database)
  3389 = RDP (remote desktop)


OUTPUT FORMAT
-------------
How nmap saves its findings:

No Output
    Just display results on screen, don't save to file.

Grepables (-oG)
    Saves results in a format that's easy to parse with grep and other Unix
    tools. Perfect if you need to process results with scripts later.

XML (-oX)
    Saves results as XML, which is great for importing into other tools or
    creating custom reports. CardioNet can parse XML files into a beautifully
    formatted readable text report with all scan details organized by host,
    port, service, and OS information.

NOTE: 
    Normal output (-oN) is always saved alongside your chosen format for
    comprehensive logging. This is necessary because grepable format only
    captures summary lines, while normal output preserves all scan details for reference.


EXTRA OPTIONS
-------------
Click "Extra Options" to reveal three powerful scanning features:

OS Detection (-O)
  What it does: Attempts to identify the operating system of discovered
               hosts.
  Speed impact: Moderate slowdown
  Accuracy: Usually pretty good, but not always 100%
  Use when: You need to know what systems you're scanning
  Example output: "Running: Linux 5.x|6.x"

Version Detection (-sV)
  What it does: Probes open ports to determine what services and versions
               are running.
  Speed impact: Significant slowdown (but very useful!)
  Accuracy: Excellent
  Use when: You need to know if services are outdated/vulnerable
  Example output: "Apache httpd 2.4.41"

Verbose Mode (-vv)
  What it does: Makes nmap print extra details about what it's doing.
  Speed impact: None
  Use when: Debugging or learning how nmap works
  Output: More lines, more information


SCRIPTS
-------
Nmap has a massive library of automated security scripts. Click "Open Scripts"
to access them.

How it works:
  1. Type a filter pattern (like ftp-* for FTP scripts)
  2. Click "Filter" to see matching scripts
  3. Click a script to see its description
  4. Click "Apply" to include it in your scan

Common scripts:
  - ssl-cert: Check SSL certificate info
  - ftp-anon: Test for anonymous FTP access
  - smb-os-discovery: Detect Windows systems
  - http-title: Grab website titles
  - dns-brute: Brute force DNS subdomains

What happens: When you apply a script, your command gets --script=scriptname
added automatically.


ACTION BUTTONS
--------------
Run (R)
  Executes your configured scan and streams live results to the right panel.
  Watch in real-time as nmap discovers your network!

Clear (C)
  Clears the results panel so you can run a fresh scan without old data
  cluttering things up.

Export (E)
  Saves results to a file based on your chosen output format (Grepable or
  XML).

Manual (?)
  Shows this manual right in the results panel. Great for quick reference
  without leaving the app!

THE COMMAND LINE PATTERN
------------------------
Every scan in CardioNet builds a command like this:

  nmap -sS -T4 -p 1-1000 -O -sV 192.168.1.0/24

Breaking it down:
  nmap: The command itself
  -sS: Scan type (SYN scan)
  -T4: Timing template (aggressive)
  -p 1-1000: Port range
  -O: Detect OS
  -sV: Detect versions
  192.168.1.0/24: Your target

Pro tip: Watch the command preview as you change settings—it's the best way
to learn nmap syntax!

================================================================================
COMMON SCANNING SCENARIOS
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: Quick Host Discovery
--------------------------------
Goal: "Is anything alive on my network?"

Configuration:
  Target: 192.168.1.0/24
  Scan Type: Host Discovery (-sn)
  Timing: T4
  Ports: (doesn't matter for host discovery)
  Run!

Why: Host discovery is the fastest way to see what's up and running.


SCENARIO 2: Find Open Web Servers
---------------------------------
Goal: "What web servers are running on this network?"

Configuration:
  Target: 192.168.1.0/24
  Scan Type: SYN (-sS)
  Timing: T4
  Ports: 80,443
  Enable: Version Detection
  Add Script: http-title
  Run!

Why: SYN scan is fast, ports 80/443 filter for web traffic, version detection
tells you the server type, and the script grabs page titles.


SCENARIO 3: Deep System Analysis
--------------------------------
Goal: "Tell me everything about this server"

Configuration:
  Target: 192.168.1.100
  Scan Type: SYN (-sS)
  Timing: T3 (Normal, thorough)
  Ports: 1-65535 (all ports, will take time)
  Enable: OS Detection, Version Detection, Verbose
  Run!

Why: SYN is reliable, scanning all ports finds everything, OS/version
detection gives the full picture, verbose shows you what nmap is doing.


SCENARIO 4: Stealthy Reconnaissance (Advanced)
-----------------------------------------------
Goal: "Scan without being obvious"

Configuration:
  Target: 192.168.1.0/24
  Scan Type: FIN (-sF)
  Timing: T2 (Polite)
  Ports: 22,80,443,3306
  Run!

Why: FIN scan is stealthy, slow timing is less obvious, limited ports mean
less network noise.


SCENARIO 5: Security Assessment
--------------------------------
Goal: "Find potential vulnerabilities"

Configuration:
  Target: 192.168.1.100
  Scan Type: SYN (-sS)
  Timing: T3
  Ports: 1-10000
  Enable: Version Detection, Verbose
  Add Script: Search for vulnerability-related scripts like ssl-*, smb-*, etc.
  Run!

Why: Version detection finds outdated software, scripts run automatic security
checks, comprehensive port range finds misconfigured services.


================================================================================
PRO TIPS
================================================================================

1. Always start with a small scope. Don't scan 192.168.0.0/8 on your first
   try—start with a single host or small subnet.

2. Watch the command preview. It teaches you nmap syntax. After a while,
   you'll understand commands at a glance.

3. Use timing templates wisely. T4 is usually great for internal networks,
   but T1-T2 for external scanning.

4. Version detection is slow but worth it. Knowing exactly what versions
   are running helps identify vulnerabilities.

5. Scripts can be slow too. Run specific scripts you need rather than all
   scripts at once.

6. Keep logs of your scans. Export results so you can compare scans over time
   and track changes.

7. Test on your own network first. CardioNet is powerful—practice on networks
   you own before using it elsewhere.


================================================================================
ETHICAL NOTE
================================================================================

CardioNet is a powerful tool. Only scan networks you own or have explicit
permission to scan. Unauthorized network scanning may be illegal. Use
responsibly and ethically!
